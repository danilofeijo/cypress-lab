# This workflow will do a clean install of node dependencies, cache/restore them, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions

# TODO - Review the workflow. Make it leaner.
#         Should have less steps;
#         Should have steps with clearer name;
